OMAKE is a gnu-like make utility.  It is part of the [Orange C](https://www.github.com/LADSoft/OrangeC) toolchain.   It processes most aspects of the gnu make file format, and runs commands as needed to create some type of output, which is usually a program.

Source Code for OMAKE is released under the GNU General Public License version 3.

The [Appveyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/LADSoft/ORC) project for this repository builds a setup file after each checkin.   It uses `OMAKE` to do this.   The project can be built either by running OMAKE, or by using the VS2019 solution which is included.
