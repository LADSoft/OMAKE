## OMake

 OMake currently has no documentation.  OMake is however very similar to GNU make; but it should be stressed that OMake is not GNU make and there may be incompatibilities.  One known incompatibility is that OMake is case sensitive, even though it is being hosted on MSDOS/Windows.  This may be fixed in a future version.
